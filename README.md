# AUBURN SOLAR MAINTENANCE SCHEDULER

## Description of project
The Auburn Solar App will provide a way for customers to schedule maintenance requests. Generator servicers will be able to select their availability on a calendar, and customers will be able to select those days and times and it will update the servicers, and set up payments and pay through the app.

## Introduction
The communication between people needing generator maintenance, owners having to take these calls and work with the managers to ask the servicers on when they can get to the customer, then the time proposal must go back up the line of communication to see if it works for the customer. This is very inefficient and wastes a lot of time.

## Purpose
This app will allow existing generator customers to schedule maintenance requests or select a recurring maintenance plan. The way this will work: Auburn Solar employees that service the generators will be able to use the app to layout a schedule of when they are available. Customers will then be able to look at available time slots and select them to schedule their appointment for maintenance. This eliminates the need for customers to call the company, and anything that can save on call volume is great because they get a LOT of calls!

## Scope
This app will allow customers to schedule maintenance requests and allow workers to see maintenance requests that have been scheduled in the blocks of time that the worker has set for themselves. 

## Technologies Used
